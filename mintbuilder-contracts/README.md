# EVM MintBuilder Contracts
Contains the Solidity smart contracts, unit tests, and deployment script for EVM MintBuilder.

## Running Unit Tests
Unit Tests are non-standard; do not run `npx hardhat test`. Instead, run `npm run test` or `yarn test`. This is because the unit tests have some additional setup and are written in CoffeeScript.

## Deploying
Deployment script has not yet been written. Once they've been written, deploy the contracts with `npm run deploy` or `yarn deploy`.
